**Project Description:**
Skin Cancer is the abnormal growth of the skin cells. There are two main categories of Skin Cancer – Keratinocyte Carcinoma and Melanoma. There are various symptoms of Skin Cancer but people neglect those and considers that as an ordinary skin infection. Thus, in order to check whether that infection is a Skin Cancer or an ordinary infection we have developed a Skin Cancer Detector named "Carcinomator".

The Skin Cancer Detector will give us an early prediction of the skin disease i.e. either Skin Cancer or not and with that information the sufferers can treat it quickly. We will be developing a Web Application comprising of four tabs which are as follows:-

• Home: It will give the detailed information about the Skin Cancer Disease and how to get accustomed with the Prototype or Model.

• Predictor: The Predictor tab contains two features- the Scan Predictor and the Symptoms Predictor. The Scan Predictor will contain the Detector where the user can upload photo of their skin problem and check whether that problem is Skin Cancer or not. The Detector will give a probability of predicting the Skin Cancer Disease. The Symptoms Predictor part will contain some set of questions where the user will be asked to fill those questions and based on his/her response the Model will give an immediate reply whether those Symptoms are of Skin Cancer or not.

• Tracker: It contains a map showing the different Cancer Treatment Hospitals of India and also the World which will allow the patient to know about the different Cancer Treatment Hospitals with their Location so that they can use that Information for the treatment.

• Helpline: It contains a list of all Renowned Dermatologist of India with their location of practice and also the Doctor’s Background. In this Tab we will also provide some safety measures to be taken care in case of skin cancer. We will also provide some Online Pharmaceutical Stores which the patients can use it to book the medicines required for their treatment.

The Extra Feature we added it in is an automated AI based chatbot which will provide with each and every detailed information regarding the portal. We have developed this Skin Cancer Detector Prototype with the help of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PHP, AI, ML, GOOGLE API & GOOGLE MAPS
